# Automatically load every file in APP_ROOT/app/models/*.rb, e.g.,
#   autoload "Person", 'app/models/person.rb'
#
# We have to do this in case we have models that inherit from each other.
# If model Student inherits from model Person and app/models/student.rb is
# required first, it will throw an error saying "Person" is undefined.
#
# With this lazy-loading technique, Ruby will try to load app/models/person.rb
# the first time it sees "Person" and will only throw an exception if
# that file doesn't define the Person class.
